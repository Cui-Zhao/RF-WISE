# RF-WISE
RF-Wise is the first work to obtain fine-grained CSI-like sensing samples purely from RFID signals to advance RFID sensing. It is a software solution atop standard RFID without using any extra device, compatible to EPC Gen2 within ISM band, requires one tag for sensing and is generic for various applications.
