# RF-WISE
RF-Wise is the first work to obtain fine-grained CSI-like sensing samples purely from RFID signals to advance RFID sensing. It is a software solution atop standard RFID without using any extra device, compatible to EPC Gen2 within ISM band, requires one tag for sensing and is generic for various applications.

## Hardware
RF-Wise is developed using:
1) USRP X310;
2) SBX Daughterboard;
3) Intel Converged Network Adapter X520-DA1;
4) 10 Gigabit Ethernet Cable & 10G SFP+ Transceiver;
5) Laird S9028PCR Antenna (x2);
6) Commodity RFID tags.

## Software
The back-end of RF-Wise runs on the EPC Gen2 protocol using:
1) GNU Radio 3.7;
2) UHD 3.15;
3) Ubuntu 18.04.

## Guide
The following guide assumes that the environment has been configured, especially the GNU Radio.
1) Download our codes and connect the devices;
2) Set your PC's IP adress as 192.168.40.xx, open a ternimal and input `uhd_find_device`
